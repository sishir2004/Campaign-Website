    <div class="Requirements">
    <p>Characters in RPGs are undoubtedly the most important aspects of any campaign. Player Characters specifically are the <em>one</em> aspect that is absolutely necessary for a campaing. After all,
        what good is a story without any main characters? PCs can be created in a number of ways, and most have a backstory created by the players in order to allow those characters to play who they want
        to play.</p>

      <h3>Stats</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="stats">
      <p>In order to create an RPG character, most systems use a specific sheet of paper or a table, which has a list of attributes the character has to prioritize using numerical values. Below is an
        example of one such character sheet.</p>
        <table align="center">
            <tr>
              <th>Skill</th><th>Points invested in Skill</th>
            </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Intelligence</td><td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Wisdom</td><td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Dexterity</td><td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Strength</td><td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Charisma</td><td>3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Constitution</td><td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Vigor</td><td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Stamina</td><td>5</td>
          </tr>
          <tfoot>
            <tr>
              <td>Total Points Invested</td><td>30</td>
            </tr>
          </tfoot>
        </table>
        <p>The table above shows you various character attributes. Each attribute has a certain number attached to it, which serves as the indicator of how much of this attribute your character has. Suppose
          a character has 5 strength and 4 dexterity. This means they have prioritized Strength over Dexterity, meaning they are more likely to be able to handle larger, more powerful weapons. These character
          sheets serve as the main skill set of your character, and is one of the most important things in any RPG. They can also come in various different ways. Some character sheets will give you a point
          maximum. These character sheets allow you to allot the exact number of points you want to each attribute. However, some character sheets, such as the Dungeons and Dragons 5E character sheet, will
          give you point values that you must allot to each and every attribute. Suppose you had the attributes Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma. The Dungeons and Dragons 5E character sheet will
          give you the point values 15, 14, 12, 10. You need to assign one of these numbers to each of those attributes above. So an example would be:
          <table align="center">
            <tr>
              <th>Skill</th><th>Points Alloted</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Strength</td><td>15</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Dexterity</td><td>14</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Intelligence</td><td>12</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Charisma</td><td>10</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>The table above shows you how a DnD 5E character sheet's stat list might be structured. Obviously it's not entirely accurate, as the DnD 5E character sheet has a much, much larger number of
          attributes that must be filled out.

        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>Aside from Stats and Attributes, another key part of character creation is the character's backstory and past.  The backstory of a character consists of the various experiences he/she has
          before the beginning of the story. These experiences are what motivate them to follow the campaign's storyline. If your character has no backstory, they are simple husks, who seem to simply be
          following the storyline just because they can.</p>

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>The character's backstory and personality are intertwined. Even if you have a backstory, your character needs to have a personality that was shaped by that backstory. If your character's Backstory
          consists of their parents being murdered right in front of their eyes, you wouldn't expect them to be a cheerful person who goes about their daily lives as happy as can be. You would expect them
          to be traumatized by that incident. This trauma would cause them to have a different outlook on life than, say, a character who still lives with their friends and family, in a happy, undisturbed,
          quite life. Because of this, the character's personality can be one of the most important parts of a campaign. The personality also justifies the various decisions they make. Suppose your characters
          are rogue-ish assassins who never see the happiness in life. This would mean that it would be perfectly justified if the character decided to take every single precaution before proceeding with an
          action. The characters' backstories and personalities are likely to be the most important parts of them, and could decide how the story progresses. And did I mention the GM takes these backstories
          into account when creating the story, and can sometimes base certain plot points around a character's past? Well if I didn't, I sure as hell did now.</p>
