      <h1>Story and System Tips</h2>
        <div id="MainConceptsParagraph">
      <p>There are two main concepts that form an RPG's story. There's the actual <strong>plot</strong>, which is the main storyline of the RPG, and then there's the <strong>system</strong>.
        The system of an RPG is the collection of the mechanics of that RPG. I'll go into more detail about both of these in the paragraphs below.</p>

      <h2>Story of a Campaign</h2>
      <p>The story of a campaign is obviously the most important part. Without a proper story, with a great plot, setting, and characters, a campaign literally cannot exist. The story
        is <b>everything</b>. A good story needs a few basic requirements:
        <ol>
          <li>Comprehensiveness
            <ul>
              <li>Needs to make sense</li>
              <li>Needs to be simple enough for people to understand without a massive explanation</li>
              <li>The events need to follow a set chronological order</li>
            </li>
          </ul>
            <li>Needs an interesting plot
              <ul>
                <li>Story needs to be fun and interesting to explore</li>
                <li>Needs to be based off of an interesting premise</li>
                <li>Needs to follow the format of a story's plot
                  <ul>
                    <li>Exposition
                      <ul>
                        <li>Introduce characters</li>
                        <li>Explain conflict</li>
                        <li>Deliver the story's backstory</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Rising action
                      <ul>
                        <li>Get the characters hooked onto a part of the story</li>
                        <li>Explore that storyline</li>
                        <li>Get the players to start learning things about the plot and where it's headed. *Note* Don't explain too much of the mystery too quickly, otherwise people will
                        find out what the climax is before actually reaching that point in the story</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Climax
                      <ul>
                        <li>The point where the story gets the most heated</li>
                        <li>Get the characters to enter an exciting moment, like a boss battle or a sequence that is different from the rest of the game</li>
                        <li>Resolve a large part of the conflict</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Falling Action
                      <ul>
                        <li>Start to draw the players away from that climactic moment, into the rest of the plot</li>
                        <li>Restate certain plot points that haven't been finished off by the climax</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolution
                      <ul>
                        <li>Weed out the last remaining plot points</li>
                        <li>Give the players some sort of reward for finishing the campaign, like a hero's welcome, for example</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              </ul></li>
        </ol>

      <h2>RPG Systems</h2>
      <p>Aside from the story of a campaign, another important part is the system. Without a system, the campaign is just a story. The system makes the RPG an actualy RPG, because how can you
        play a Role-Playing Game without a system to allow you actually Role-Play? Systems are what separate RPGs from "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" Stories and normal book plots. The system of an RPG
        is basically comprised of all the uses for dice rolls. Suppose you had an armor class, and before every attack, an enemy had to roll a D20 to see if they got a number higher than your armor
        class in order to see if they actually hit you. This is an example of a part of the system of that RPG. People can get really creative with RPG systems. However, don't make your system too
        intricate though, as sometimes they can become too complicated, making them tedious to play through. Then again, don't make them too simple, as then you're basically just playing through a
        "Choose-Your-Own-Adventure" Story. Just find a middle ground that makes the system creative, but not too complicated. An RPG system is only limited by your imagination.</p>
