      <h1>Your RPG Ideas!</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>In this page, you guys will be encouraged to type out your own RPG ideas. Be sure to be detailed in all of your posts, as there will be people looking at and replying to them, myself included.
      </p>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The first thing you need to do is add your story/plot ideas for your campaign. Just type up your setting and basic plot details. BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPOIL THE STORY! If you add
          too many details in your post, people who'd want to play out your campaign might end up finding out something about the story you wanted to save until later. For the sake of your
          player characters and story, only add the bare minimum for someone to understand the premise of the campaign. This means adding the setting; when, where, what happened to cause all of this,
          who is the antagonist, etc.</li>
        <li>
          In addition to your story/plot details, you also need to add your ideas for the system of your campaign. This means adding the uses for all of your dice, talking about how your story's
          combat and speaking systems work, and detailing any innovative or unique ideas you had for various parts of your campaign. If you'd like to look at an example of a campaign post, just take a
          look at the "My Ideas" tab, where I'll be posting my own ideas. Also, be sure to check your posts frequently, as there will be people commenting and sharing their thoughts/suggestions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>Because this is the internet, and because there are sometimes psychotic people on the internet, I think it's only fair to establish a strict list of ground rules. They are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>No negativity. If you see something in a system that you don't agree with, talk to the author of that post POLITELY and find a way to make the system better. Use constructive criticism.</li>
          <li>NO SWEAR WORDS!!! If someone starts using swear words or offensive language, contact me using my email. DO NOT ESCALATE THE SITUATION! It will only result in the IMMEDIATE blacklisting
            of your IP</li>
            <li>Copy down your posts so that they don't get lost. The last thing any of us want is for your post to be lost in a sea of other people's comments, never to be found again, but sometimes that will happen.
              A good way to make sure this doesn't completely destroy your idea would be to copy it down and put in Google Docs. That way, you don't lose the idea you had.</li>
            <li>Finally, HAVE FUN! This is a creative space where you can feel free to share your ideas, no matter how weak you think they may be, and we can all pitch in and help you become a better GM.
              Don't be afraid to ask for help or suggestions, as most of the people here are fairly nice and will try their best to help you out.</li>
        </ul>
