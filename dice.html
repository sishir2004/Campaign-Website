      <h1>Dice</h1>
      <p>Before getting into all the technical stuff about RPGs, one must first understand the dice used in an RPG. Without dice, an RPG is the equivalent of a choose your own adventure story
        where you always perform the actions, no matter how absurd they are. The dice add an element of failure to an RPG. Suppose you wanted to climb a wall. In a choose your own adventure story,
        there would be nothing stopping you. However, in an RPG, you must role the dice to see if you have the ability to make it up that wall. Combining the roll of the dice with the stats of the
        character that was created, you can add a lot more depth to your stories and encounters. Most RPGs use 6 dice. These dice are classified by the letter 'D', which stands for Die, followed by
        the number of sides the Die has. Suppose you had a 20 sided die, it would be called a D20. The 6 dice most commonly used are the D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and the D4. I have shown pictures and listed
        the features of these dice below.</p>

      <h3>D20</h3>

      <h5 class="Dice-Description">A D20 is a basic 20-sided Die that has equilateral triangle-shaped sides numbered 1-20.</h5>

      <p>Most times D20s are used for basic check-rolls, such as Dexterity checks and strength checks. Most of
        the time these checks are used to make sure someone can pull off an action. For example if someone wanted to run up a wall, depending on the size of the wall and the dexterity level of the
        character, the GM (Game Master) will choose a certain number from 1-20, and if the player rolls a number equal to or greater than the target. Normally when rolling a D20, you have anywhere between
      a 5% success rate and a 95% success rate. In addition, I sometimes use D20s for damage rolls concerning extremely powerful, anti-infantry weapons, such as bombs and Tank Cannons.</p>

      <h3>D12</h3>
      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/preview.thegamecrafter.com/C2AC5B0E-0AB5-11E3-B912-34787740BD4B.png">
      <hr>
      <h5 class="Dice-Description">D12s are 12 sided dice with pentagonal faces numbered 1-12.</h5>

      <p>D12s are quite rarely used in a campaign, at least from my experience. Most of the time, these dice are used for damage rolls, and some very simple skill rolls. Mainly, D12s are used for
        damage rolls regarding very strong weapons, used by the strongest classes in the game, such as warriors and brutes. In addition, D12s are used when PCs and NPCs have anywhere between a 8.3%
      and 91.6% chance of success</p>

      <h3>D10</h3>
      <img src="https://vector.me/files/images/3/2/324347/ten_sided_dice" id="D10">
      <hr>
      <h5 class="Dice-Description">D10s are 10 sided dice with kite shaped faces numbered 1-10.</h5>

      <p>The D10, much like the D12, is a die normally used for Damage rolls in RPGs, but can also sometimes be used to determine success rates for rolls that do not require the precision of a D20.
        Suppose the player character has a Dex of 12 and the wall needs a minimum Dex of 5 to climb over. Seeing as the character is overqualified, a D10 can be used to determine success rather than
        a D20. In addition, D10s are used to determine the damage rolls of some medium damage weaponry. Examples of classes using the D10 for damage would be the Knight class, if they're using a
        longsword or a Greatsword. in addition, D12s are used when PCs and NPCs have anywhere between a 10% and 90% chance of success.</p>

        <h3>D8</h3>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/preview.thegamecrafter.com/7F1964F4-0AB5-11E3-BE47-34787740BD4B.png">
        <hr>
        <h5 class="Dice-Description">D8s are 8 sided dice with Equilateral Triangle shaped faces numbered 1-8.</h5>

        <p>The D8, much like the D12, is mainly used for damage rolls, mainly those involving shortswords and other weapons that have a relatively intermediate damage output. These dice are mainly used
          by classes like Archers and bowmen. In addition, these are used when PCs and NPCs have anywhere between a 12.5% and 87.5% chance of success</p>

        <hr>
        <h5 class="Dice-Description">D6s are your average 6 sided, cube-faced dice, numbered 1-6</h5>

        <p> The D6 is used for rolls involving weapons with low damage output, or weapons that have an added damage bonus, like piercing or blunt. D6s are also sometimes used for rolls where the Player character
        or NPC has anywhere between a 1/6 and a 5/6 chance of succeeding.</p>

        <hr>
        <h5 class="Dice-Description">D4s are 4 sided dice that have equilateral triangle-shaped faces numbered 1-4</h5>

        <p>The D4 is normally used for broken weapons or rolls where your chance of success is anywhere between 25% and 75%.</p>

        <p>Besides the main Dice shown above, there are also 2 optional dice that can be used when playing an RPG. These dice are not necessary, and are only used in the most specific

          <h3>D100</h3>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <h5>The D100 is a 100-sided almost completely spherical die that has hexagonal faces, each numbered 1-100</h5>

          <p>D100s are almost never used in RPGs unless you want to try and create a percentage roll. Normally, percentage rolls are used when there is a certain percentage of something happening.
            Suppose there's 75% chance of a bomb going off, the GM rolls a D100 and if the roll is anywhere between a 1 and a 75, the bomb goes off.</p>

          <h3>D3</h3>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <h5>The D3 is a three sided dice with edges numbered 1-3.</h5>
          <p>The D3 is used for probability scenarios when ther is anywhere between a 1/3-2/3 chance of success in an action. An example of this would be if there were 2 red marbles
             and one white marble in a bag. The player would roll a D3, and if they got a 2 or higher, they would pick up a red marble. If they rolled a one, they would pick up a white
             marble. </p>
