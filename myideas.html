      <h3>Story/Plot Details</h3>
        <p>For my first post, I've decided to create a campaign based off of the amazing anime series "Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion". For those of you who haven't seen the anime yet, the story's set in an
        alternate version of modern day Japan. The world is much different from ours, consisting of mainly just 5-6 nations, the biggest of which is called "Britannia". The Britannian army has waged war on almost
        every country, and has taken control of most of the world. Their reign has spread like a cancer throughout the planet, and they've caused endless suffering both to their own subjects, as well as to the
        people who come from different nations. One such nation is Japan, which was conquered and populated by Britannia. The Japanese have been driven to ghettos and prisons, and are being treated as lesser human
        beings. Because of this, various Japanese people have come together to form a group of "terrorists" called The Black Knights, lead by a mysterious man named Zero. In this version of the story, Zero dies before the
        end of the war, sacrificing himself to save his sister, Nunnally, from the Britannian Emperor's right hand, Cornelia Vi Britannia. The Black Knights were able to establish a foothold on the freedom of Japan, but after
        Zero's death, they had to fight as hard as they could to keep that foothold in place, for Zero was not only their leader, but their greatest strategist. This is where the Player Characters come into the fray. The Black Knights
        have begun recruiting people into their ranks in order to increase the size of their army. The Player Characters are to enter the Black Knights' ranks, and begin climbing their way up the status ladder. As they do so, they must
        fight back Britannia, and finish what Zero started. They must free Japan and destroy Britannia.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
      <h3>System</h3>
        <br>
          <p>Player Characters are split into two groups: Combatants and Strategists. Combatants are the ones at the front lines of the war, leading the army to victory via
            brute force and destruction. Because of this, their builds will usually focus on Strength or Dexterity, as those are the most useful stats for them to have. Strategists are the
            people pulling the strings, winning the war by creating great strategies for the Black Knights to employ, as well as cutting deals and making alliances with various other organizations
            and governments.</p>
